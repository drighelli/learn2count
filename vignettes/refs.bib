@article{Sikdar2017,
abstract = {Transcription factors are known to play key roles in carcinogenesis and therefore, are gaining popularity as potential therapeutic targets in drug development. A ‘master regulator' transcription factor often appears to control most of the regulatory activities of the other transcription factors and the associated genes. This ‘master regulator' transcription factor is at the top of the hierarchy of the transcriptomic regulation. Therefore, it is important to identify and target the master regulator transcription factor for proper understanding of the associated disease process and identifying the best therapeutic option. We present a novel two-step computational approach for identification of master regulator transcription factor in a genome. At the first step of our method we test whether there exists any master regulator transcription factor in the system. We evaluate the concordance of two ranked lists of transcription factors using a statistical measure. In case the concordance measure is statistically significant, we conclude that there is a master regulator. At the second step, our method identifies the master regulator transcription factor, if there exists one. In the simulation scenario, our method performs reasonably well in validating the existence of a master regulator when the number of subjects in each treatment group is reasonably large. In application to two real datasets, our method ensures the existence of master regulators and identifies biologically meaningful master regulators. An R code for implementing our method in a sample test data can be found in 
                    http://www.somnathdatta.org/software
                    
                  . We have developed a screening method of identifying the ‘master regulator' transcription factor just using only the gene expression data. Understanding the regulatory structure and finding the master regulator help narrowing the search space for identifying biomarkers for complex diseases such as cancer. In addition to identifying the master regulator our method provides an overview of the regulatory structure of the transcription factors which control the global gene expression profiles and consequently the cell functioning.},

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {Floral homeotic transcription factors (TFs) act in a combinatorial manner to specify the organ identities in the flower. However, the architecture and the function of the gene regulatory network (GRN) controlling floral organ specification is still poorly understood. In particular, the interconnections of homeotic TFs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other factors controlling organ initiation and growth have not been studied systematically so far. Here, using a combination of genome-wide TF binding, mRNA and miRNA expression data, we reconstruct the dynamic GRN controlling floral meristem development and organ differentiation. We identify prevalent feed-forward loops (FFLs) mediated by floral homeotic TFs and miRNAs that regulate common targets. Experimental validation of a coherent FFL shows that petal size is controlled by the SEPALLATA3-regulated miR319/TCP4 module. We further show that combinatorial DNA-binding of homeotic factors and selected other TFs is predictive of organ-specific patterns of gene expression. Our results provide a valuable resource for studying molecular regulatory processes underlying floral organ specification in plants. Homeotic transcription factors and miRNAs promote floral organ specification. Here Chen et al. reconstruct gene regulatory networks in Arabidopsis flowers and find evidence for feed forward loops between transcription factors, miRNAs and their targets that determine organ-specific gene expression.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {Notch signaling mediates multiple developmental decisions in Drosophila. In this study, we have examined the role of Notch signaling in Drosophila larval optic lobe development. Loss of function in Notch or its ligand Delta leads to loss of the lamina and a smaller medulla. The neuroepithelial cells in the optic lobe in Notch or Delta mutant brains do not expand but instead differentiate prematurely into medulla neuroblasts, which lead to premature neurogenesis in the medulla. Clonal analyses of loss-of-function alleles for the pathway components, including N, Dl, Su(H), and E(spl)-C, indicate that the Delta/Notch/Su(H) pathway is required for both maintaining the neuroepithelial stem cells and inhibiting medulla neuroblast formation while E(spl)-C is only required for some aspects of the inhibition of medulla neuroblast formation. Conversely, Notch pathway overactivation promotes neuroepithelial cell expansion while suppressing medulla neuroblast formation and neurogenesis; numb loss of function mimics Notch overactivation, suggesting that Numb may inhibit Notch signaling activity in the optic lobe neuroepithelial cells. Thus, our results show that Notch signaling plays a dual role in optic lobe development, by maintaining the neuroepithelial stem cells and promoting their expansion while inhibiting their differentiation into medulla neuroblasts. These roles of Notch signaling are strikingly similar to those of the JAK/STAT pathway in optic lobe development, raising the possibility that these pathways may collaborate to control neuroepithelial stem cell maintenance and expansion, and their differentiation into the progenitor cells.},

@article{MarinNavarro2020,
abstract = {In this study, we take advantage of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neural stem cells and brain organoids to study the role of p53 during human brain development. We knocked down (KD) p53 in human neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells derived from iPS cells. Upon p53KD, NES cells rapidly show centrosome amplification and genomic instability. Furthermore, a reduced proliferation rate, downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and an upregulation of glycolytic capacity was apparent upon loss of p53. In addition, p53KD neural stem cells display an increased pace of differentiating into neurons and exhibit a phenotype corresponding to more mature neurons compared to control neurons. Using brain organoids, we modeled more specifically cortical neurogenesis. Here we found that p53 loss resulted in brain organoids with disorganized stem cell layer and reduced cortical progenitor cells and neurons. Similar to NES cells, neural progenitors isolated from brain organoids also show a downregulation in several OXPHOS genes. Taken together, this demonstrates an important role for p53 in controlling genomic stability of neural stem cells and regulation of neuronal differentiation, as well as maintaining structural organization and proper metabolic gene profile of neural progenitors in human brain organoids.},

However, the mechanisms that regulate stem cell fates under such widely varying conditions are not fully understood. Using single-cell techniques, we assessed the transcriptional changes associated with stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and followed the maturation of stem cell-derived clones using sparse lineage tracing in the regenerating mouse olfactory epithelium. Following injury, quiescent olfactory stem cells rapidly shift to activated, transient states unique to regeneration and tailored to meet the demands of injury-induced repair, including barrier formation and proliferation. Multiple cell fates, including renewed stem cells and committed differentiating progenitors, are specified during this early window of activation. We further show that Sox2 is essential for cells to transition from the activated to neuronal progenitor states. Our study highlights strategies for stem cell-mediated regeneration that may be conserved in other adult stem cell niches.},

Adult stem cells maintain and regenerate multiple mature cell lineages in the olfactory epithelium. Here we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing and robust statistical analyses with in vivo lineage tracing to define a detailed map of the postnatal olfactory epithelium, revealing cell fate potentials and branchpoints in olfactory stem cell lineage trajectories. Olfactory stem cells produce support cells via direct fate conversion in the absence of cell division, and their multipotency at the population level reflects collective unipotent cell fate decisions by single stem cells. We further demonstrate that Wnt signaling regulates stem cell fate by promoting neuronal fate choices. This integrated approach reveals the mechanisms guiding olfactory lineage trajectories and provides a model for deconstructing similar hierarchies in other stem cell niches.},

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include {\textgreater}10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

@article{Traag2019,
abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25{\%} of the communities are badly connected and up to 16{\%} are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

The edges of the graph reflect allowed conditional dependencies among the variables. Graphical models have computationally convenient factorization properties and have long been a valuable tool for tractable modeling of multivariate distributions. More recently, applications such as reconstructing gene regulatory networks from gene expression data have driven major advances in structure learning, that is, estimating the graph underlying a model. We review some of these advances and discuss methods such as the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection for undirected graphical models (or Markov random fields) and the PC algorithm and score-based search methods for directed graphical models (or Bayesian networks). We further review extensions that account for effects of latent variables and heterogeneous data sources. }

Alike, tumors are organized in a hierarchical manner, with cancer SCs residing at the apex, contributing to the development and nourishment of tumors. p53, the well-known ‘guardian of the genome’, possesses various roles in embryonic development as well as in adult SC life and serves as the ‘guardian of tissue hierarchy’. Moreover, p53 serves as a barrier for dedifferentiation and reprogramming by constraining the cells to a somatic state and preventing their conversion to SCs. On the contrary, the mutant forms of p53 that lost their tumor suppressor activity and gain oncogenic functions serve as ‘inducers of tissue anarchy’ and promote cancer development. In this review, we discuss these two sides of the p53 token that sentence a tissue either to an ordered hierarchy and life or to anarchy and death. A better understanding of these processes may open new horizons for the development of new cancer therapies.}",

abstract = "This paper introduces two new probabilistic graphical models for reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks using DNA microarray data. One is an independence graph (IG) model with either a forward or a backward search algorithm and the other one is a Gaussian network (GN) model with a novel greedy search method. The performances of both models were evaluated on four MAPK pathways in yeast and three simulated data sets. Generally, an IG model provides a sparse graph but a GN model produces a dense graph where more information about geneâgene interactions may be preserved. The results of our proposed models were compared with several other commonly used models, and our models have shown to give superior performance. Additionally, we found the same common limitations in the prediction of genetic regulatory networks when using only DNA microarray data."
